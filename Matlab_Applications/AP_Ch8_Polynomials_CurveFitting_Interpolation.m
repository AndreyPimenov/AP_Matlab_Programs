% 
% Polynomials are mathematical expression that are frequently used for
% problem solving and modeling in science and enginnering. In many cases an
% equation that is written int he process of solving a problem is a
% polynomial, and the solution of the problem is the zero of the
% polynomial. 
%
% Curve fitting is a process of finding a fucntion that can be used to
% model data. The function does not necessarily pass through any of the
% points, but models the data with the smallest possible error. There are
% no limitations to the type of the equations that can be used for curve 
% fitting. Often, however, polynomial, exponential, and power functions 
% are used.    
%
% Interpolation is the process of estimating values between data points. 
% The simplest kind of interpolation is done by drawing a straight line 
% between the points. In a more sophistikated interpolation, data from
% additional points is used.
